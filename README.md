# Topology-API
In this program, we can read a topology, write a topology,delete a topology, query all topologies, query components and netlists for each topology.
As we can see from code, topology is a class which enables to read a file or write into it. Also we can query components and netlists inside it through given functions.
Also we made a big class that may contain a lot of topologies. It's just like a library that contain many books.
