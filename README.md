# Topology-API
In this program, we can read a topology, write a topology,delete a topology, query all topologies, query components and netlists for each topology.
As we can see from code, topology is a class which enables to read a file or write into it. Also we can query components and netlists inside it through given functions.
Also we made a big class that may contain a lot of topologies. It's just like a library that contain many books.

I chose JavaScript language because it deals perfectly with JSON files and because it's the most likely language for web and servers.

# Test Cases

* This test case for the topology class that read, write and query components and netlists

NOTICE that javascript terminal may cause a little misarrangements of console.logs due to the speed of execution

* Now testing the big Topologies class that contain many topologies to test adding, quereing and removing topologies.
